            <h1 id="article-title">Community</h1>
            <p>On this page, we will discuss various examples of community in Studio Ghibli films.</p>
            <p>In Japanese culture, there is a strong sense of community, being a part of something larger than yourself. VS American culture, which is very focused on individualism. Both have positives and negatives, but in Ghibli films, there is a strong sense of "it takes a village."</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Castle in the Sky: Although they start out as antagonists in the film, Dola and her pirate family become friends with Sheeta and Pazu, often going out of their way to protect them.</li>
                    <li>Castle in the Sky: The villagers also help Sheeta and Pazu when they realize that the military are trying to kidnap Sheeta.</li>
                    <li>Kiki's Delivery Service: The baker Fukuo, the baker's wife Osono, the young artist Ursula, and the grandmother all aid Kiki in her journey, reminding her that she is not alone.</li>
                    <li>Whisper of the Heart: Amasawa's grandfather aids Shizuku by offering to be the first person to read her novel and give her feedback on it.</li>
                  </ul>

                <h2 class="section-header">Practicing a craft with intention</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Kiki's Delivery Service: When Kiki is feeling stuck and has lost her ability to use magic, she meets Ursula, an artist who instructs her to spend time in nature, take a moment to admire simple things, to feel more like herself.

                    <li>Whisper of the Heart: Seiji both plays the violin and practices carving violins from wood. It is his dream to become a master violin-maker.</li>
                    <li>Whisper of the Heart: After being encouraged by Seiji's grandfather, Shizuku finds the inner strength to begin working on writing her novel. She diligently works on her novel each night after finishing her homework.</li>
                    <li>Castle in the Sky: Pazu plays the trumpet each morning to awaken his town. It is not technically necessary, but it is a craft he practices with intention.</li>
                  </ul>
                <h2 class="section-header">Admiring nature, taking a moment to breathe</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Secret World of Arrietty: Shou is sent to stay with his grandmother in the countryside for his health. There are moments where he lays in the grass in the garden and admires the flowers.</li>
                    <li>Castle in the Sky: Sheeta and Pazu admire not only the forgotten ruins of the floating city of Laputa, but also the nature that has somehow managed to survive there after the island's abandonment.</li>
                    <li>Howl's Moving Castle: There are many moments where both Sophie and Howl look out at the scenery and admire nature.</li>
                  </ul>
                <h2 class="section-header">Cleaning as meditation</h2>  
                <ul>
                  <li>Howl's Moving Castle: Sophie spends a lot of the film cleaning Howl's castle. And while cleaning may not necessarily be a craft, it is a physical action that can be done with intention. It is another form of meditation.</li>
                  <li>Spirited Away: Chihiro is forced to clean in the bathhouse as a servant, but the film shows how her attitude changes from beginning to end, and cleaning is one of the activities that makes an impact on her.</li>
